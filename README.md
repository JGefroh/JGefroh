# Hi! I'm Joseph.

I'm a hands-on leader with 7+ years of software engineering experience, and 6+ years of experience managing engineering teams.

I've led over 12 teams on major systems across both startups and enterprises, wearing multiple hats in the process - from engineer to architect to product manager to director.
