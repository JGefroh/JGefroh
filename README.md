# Hi! I'm Joseph. :wave:

I'm a hands-on leader with 9+ years of software engineering experience, and 8+ years of experience managing engineering teams.

I've led over 12 teams on major systems across both startups and enterprises, wearing multiple hats in the process - from engineer to architect to product manager to director.

Some of the more fun systems I've built professionally include:
* A credit card processing and payments facilitation system
* A fundraising and donation management platform
* A job board
* A federal grant management system
* A vacation day accrual and spending system
